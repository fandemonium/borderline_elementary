Writing journals has never been my thing, even though I was forced to do so since first grade. Of course, I quitted the moment I could. Ever since blogging has become a popular culture, I gave it several tries, precisely 4 times, throughout the years. They all ended like a sour relationship (or never ended...).

This one is my 5th blog, but it is my first static blog. On top of all, I am going to make this a total self-righteous blog filled with rants and paper comments (Hey, just some personal opinions.). Because this blog is hosted by github, I think it's a good idea to publish some random codes I wrote/used over the years. They are ugly but might be useful to someone (it's very likely that person is me...). 

There you have it. Damn it, this blog better lasts!
