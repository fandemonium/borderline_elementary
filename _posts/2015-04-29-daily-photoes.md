## Lots of photoes...   
I have so many pictures (years and years worth of pictures) that I have not but need to process. Since I will never have time, I'm determined to process 3 per day to show off my Ansel Adam skills. Today's theme is Tibetan prayer flags.

+ #### This is my today's favorite! I really didn't want to crop it at all but it looks much better after centering the little tower in the middle.
