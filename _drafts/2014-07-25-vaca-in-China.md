China is a beautiful country. I have always recommended people to travel around in China and experience the different culture, sceneries and food. However, my most recent trip makes me wonder if I have ever given the wrong advice. 

I came back to China to renew my US visa and reserved extra time to wait for the visa and travel west towards Tibet with parents. Because of the difficulties of getting the train tickets, we decided to go to Huang Long (yellow dragon?) and Jiu Zhai Valley (where Hero was filmed), Sichuan provice first then fly to Lhasa, Tibet. I am at the end of my first leg of the trip and full of rage and concern, both towards the deteriration of the Chinese morality and culture.

1. Things are outrageously expensive. Yes, the prices are decend if you convert them to US dollars. But not for people who live within China. The standard living costs in China is at least 5-10 times more expensive than the US. For example, for a person who receives 5000 yuan each month, the cost of a Starbucks house brew is 20 yuan, a Dim Sum for 3 people with 5 dishes is over 100, and the napkins used during the meal is 2 yuan. The price could be translated to $20 a cup of Starbucks house brew, over $100 a daily meali (Dim Sum is an inexpensive daily eating-out type of meal in Canton area) for 3 people in the restaraunt and yes, nakpins would be an additional charge of $2, for a person with $5000 monthly salary. I swear that many people in the US would think they were going bankrupt at the above rate. 

2. The efficiency is low. The low work efficiency was observed mostly when we were shopping and eating out. Maybe it is due to the lack of tipping system, I frequently observed the waiters and waitresses standing/sitting around. Some of them were eager to get customers into the shops/restaraunts, but the working ethics within was extremely lesagic. Take bringing Dim Sum dishes out for the customers as an example, it is a very travile process that require one person (I would point at some dish, he/she would put it on a tray). However, for some reason, there are always ALWAYS at least two people working on this task! Sometimes, one would be holding the tray and standing at the far end, while the other one running back and forth. Some other times, one would simply following around another person for what I do not know!
